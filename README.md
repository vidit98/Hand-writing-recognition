# Overview
Off-line handwriting recognition involves the automatic conversion of text in an image into letter codes which are usable<br/> within computer and text-processing applications. Off-line handwriting recognition is comparatively difficult, as different<br/> people have different handwriting styles.<br/> 
In this problem statement we apply handwriting recognition on the images of both form and non forms. This application is very<br/> useful as there is a dire need to come up with technology to digitize the handwritten application, This topic is still a topic<br/> for active research and many researchers are working on the problem to come up with an application robust enough to handle all the different handwriting styles and interpret them.
